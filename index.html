			<li>Sharon Taicher</li>
			<li>Guy Peleg</li>
			<li>Yaron Raz</li>
			<li>Maor Assa</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<br style>The band "real music players" ratio is 25%, only 1 out 4 members can truely play guitar.
	<br>All the other 3 band members dont know how to play their instruments.
	<br>This is how the band explors music and validats it wont slip into "cover band" banality. 
	<br>All the songs are wrriten by the band in our weekly sessions and recorded by Erez Kaspi

	<br><h2>What makes RUHAMA40 better then the beatles</h2>
	<p>
	<br>We enjoy playing together and love spending time together.
	<br>The Beatles couldnt stend being together after 5 years.
	<br> Bottom line - We enjoy making RocknRoll rogether much more then the Beatles did
